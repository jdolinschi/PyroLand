**Pyroland** is a cross-platform desktop application that **watches an Andor Solis
acquisition folder in real time**, corrects each incoming `.sif` spectrum with
your instrument-specific calibrations, performs a pyrometric (grey-body) fit,
and plots the result instantly.

## Quick start (Windows)

| Option                      | Steps                                                                                                        | Requires Python? |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **1 ¬∑ One-click EXE**       | 1. Download **Pyroland-1.0.0.exe** from the [Releases] page.<br>2. Double-click.                             | **No** |
| **2 ¬∑ Poetry / developers** | `git clone https://github.com/jdolinschi/PyroLand`<br>`cd PyroLand`<br>`poetry install`<br>`poetry run pyroland` | **Yes** (3.11 ‚Äì 3.13) |

> **Updating**  
> ‚Ä¢ EXE users: download the newer EXE from *Releases*.  
> ‚Ä¢ Poetry users: `git pull && poetry install --sync`.

## Setting up **Andor Solis** for live processing :telescope:

1. **Enable Auto-Save** in Solis  
   *Settings ‚Üí Auto-Save ‚Üí Enable*  
   and choose **‚ÄúSIF (*.sif*)‚Äù** as the file format.
2. Pick (or create) an output folder, e.g.  
   `D:\Experiments\2025-07-Plasma`.
3. In Pyroland click **‚ÄúSelect folder to watch‚Äù** and point it to the same folder.  
   Pyroland now tracks the directory; every new `.sif` triggers an automatic load, correction, fit, and plot.

## Detailed explanation üó∫Ô∏è

### 1.  Selecting corrections
* The right-hand list starts with all five corrections **checked**.  
* Un-check any calibration you don‚Äôt want; the plot and fit refresh automatically.  
  *Double-click* a correction to open a pop-up window describing its origin (citation, measurement method, uncertainty, ‚Ä¶).

### 2.  Global fitting range
* Fields **‚Äúx-min‚Äù** and **‚Äúx-max‚Äù** apply a single contiguous range for fitting.  
  Leave either blank to fit from the first/last data point.

### 3.  Excluded regions table
* Click **Add new region** to insert a row with two editable cells.  
  Enter **x-min** and **x-max** to *exclude* that slice from the fit.  
* Add as many regions as you like; Pyroland unions them into a final fit-mask.  
* Remove a region with the **‚ÄúX‚Äù** button in its row.  
* Invalid ranges (x-min ‚â• x-max) trigger an inline warning.

### 4.  Saving results
| Button / checkbox | What happens |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Save fit** | Opens a file dialog and writes a single `.asc` file containing raw data, corrected counts, fit curve, temperature, and metadata. |
| **Auto save fits** | Prompts once for a folder, then silently writes an `.asc` alongside every processed `.sif`. Un-tick to stop. |

### A note on **grating-efficiency curves** :warning:

Our Kymera carries **three** gratings, yet Oxford Instruments ships an efficiency
curve for only **one** of them (600 l/mm, 500 nm blaze) ‚Äì thanks, Oxford! üôÉ  
If you need curves for *your* other gratings you‚Äôll have to generate them
manually:

1. Visit <https://andor.oxinst.com/tools/resolution-calculator>.
2. Pick the **exact** grating and camera you use.
3. Slog through the web calculator entering one wavelength at a time (yes,
   really) and copy the efficiencies into a CSV. I generated a text file of all integers, comma separated, between 300 and 1500 (wavelength in nm) and copied and pasted it into their calculator.
4. Save that CSV in `src/pyroland/corrections/data/` following the same
   two-column format as the supplied `grating_600lm_500nmBlaze_efficiency.csv`.
5. Add a small corrector class (see existing examples) and you‚Äôre all set.

Maybe one day Oxford will bundle the full set of curves‚Ä¶ but until then, this
is the workaround.

## Extending / contributing :hammer_and_wrench:

1. Fork ‚Üí feature branch ‚Üí PR.  
2. `poetry run pytest` must pass (CI runs Ruff and Black).  
3. Add new calibration curves by dropping a CSV into `src/pyroland/corrections/data/` and creating a small corrector class that subclasses `BaseCorrector` (see existing examples).
